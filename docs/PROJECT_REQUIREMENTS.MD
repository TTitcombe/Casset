# Casset - Project Requirements
This document outlines the intended capabilities of the Casset system. These are divided into _required_ and _additional_. The required capabilities must be met in order for this project to be considered complete.

### Required
* Draw live and historical stock market data
* Price a portfolio of stocks and plot a basic value over time graph
* Compare multiple portfolios against one-another
* Save a user's portfolio to disk to re-load at a later time
* Monitor value of stocks at a user-set frequency and alert the user if they change under certain conditions
* Provide a basic GUI to handle this functionality

### Additional
* Provide more complex plots of data e.g. candlestick
* Draw data on other asset classes e.g. bonds
* Users can define basic trading strategies, and a backtest environment will be provided to evaluate these
* Compare portfolios by exploring simple alternatives choices e.g. "what if I bought Google shares instead of Amazon?"
